      1-5 When Jacob went to Egypt, his son Joseph was already there. So Jacob
      took his eleven other sons and their families. They were: Reuben, Simeon,
      Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
      Altogether, Jacob had seventy children, grandchildren, and
      great-grandchildren who went with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      6 After Joseph, his brothers, and everyone else in that generation had
      died, 7 the people of Israel became so numerous that the whole region of
      Goshen was full of them. 8 Many years later a new king came to power. He
      did not know what Joseph had done for Egypt, 9 and he told the Egyptians:
      There are too many of those Israelites in our country, and they are
      becoming more powerful than we are. 10 If we don't outsmart them, their
      families will keep growing larger. And if our country goes to war, they
      could easily fight on the side of our enemies and escape from Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 The Egyptians put slave bosses in charge of the people of Israel and
      tried to wear them down with hard work. Those bosses forced them to build
      the cities of Pithom and Rameses, where the king could store his supplies.
      12 But even though the Israelites were mistreated, their families grew
      larger, and they took over more land. Because of this, the Egyptians hated
      them worse than before 13 and made them work so hard 14 that their lives
      were miserable. The Egyptians were cruel to the people of Israel and
      forced them to make bricks and to mix mortar and to work in the fields. 15
      Finally, the king called in Shiphrah and Puah, the two women who helped
      the Hebrew mothers when they gave birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      16 He told them, "If a Hebrew woman gives birth to a girl, let the child
      live. If the baby is a boy, kill him!" 17 But the two women were faithful
      to God and did not kill the boys, even though the king had told them to.
      18 The king called them in again and asked, "Why are you letting those
      baby boys live?" 19 They answered, "Hebrew women have their babies much
      quicker than Egyptian women. By the time we arrive, their babies are
      already born." 20-21 God was good to the two women because they truly
      respected him, and he blessed them with children of their own. The Hebrews
      kept increasing 22 until finally, the king gave a command to everyone in
      the nation, "As soon as a Hebrew boy is born, throw him into the Nile
      River! But you can let the girls live."
