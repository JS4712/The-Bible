        1-3   
        The LORD said:
        Sacrifices to please me  must be completely burned on the bronze altar. 
        Bulls or rams or goats are the animals to be used for these sacrifices. If the animal is a bull, it must not have anything wrong with it. Lead it to the entrance of the sacred tent, and I will let you know if it is acceptable to me.
        4   Lay your hand on its head, and I will accept the animal as a sacrifice for taking away your sins.
        5   After the bull is killed in my presence, some priests from Aaron's family will offer its blood to me by splattering it against the four sides of the altar.
        </p>
        <p>
        6   Skin the bull and cut it up,
        7   while the priests pile wood on the altar fire to make it start blazing.
        8-9   Wash the bull's insides and hind legs, so the priests can lay them on the altar with the head, the fat, and the rest of the animal. A priest will then send all of it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
        10   If you sacrifice a ram or a goat, it must not have anything wrong with it.
    </p>
        11   Lead the animal to the north side of the altar, where it is to be killed in my presence. Then some of the priests will splatter its blood against the four sides of the altar.
        12-13   Cut up the animal and wash its insides and hind legs. A priest will put these parts on the altar with the head, the fat, and the rest of the animal. Then he will send all of it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
        14   If you offer a bird for this kind of sacrifice, it must be a dove or a pigeon.
        15   A priest will take the bird to the bronze altar, where he will wring its neck and put its head on the fire. Then he will drain out its blood on one side of the altar,
        16   remove the bird's craw with what is in it,  and throw them on the ash heap at the east side of the altar. 
        17   Finally, he will take the bird by its wings, tear it partially open,  and send it up in smoke with a smell that pleases me.
