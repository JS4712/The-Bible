      The Bible is a collection of religious texts and scriptures that are held
      to be sacred in Christianity, and partly in Judaism, Samaritanism, Islam,
      the Baháʼí Faith, and other Abrahamic religions. The Bible is an anthology
      (a compilation of texts of a variety of forms) originally written in
      Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. The texts include instructions, stories,
      poetry, prophecies, and other genres. The collection of materials accepted
      as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is
      called a biblical canon. Believers generally consider it to be a product
      of divine inspiration, but the way they understand what that means and
      interpret the text varies.
